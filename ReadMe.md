SIIMPL requires no installation, simply place the "SIIMPL" directory
from where you want to run the program.

However, by placing it directly under "D:\"  all examples included 
in the SIIMPL package will work without modification.

All informaiton needed to run a simulation is included in the 
file "SIIMPL Manual.pdf" 

To quick start SIIMPL, simply update the paths in the file "simulation_spec.txt", open a Windows command window, go to the siimpl.exe folder, and enter: 

..\>siimpl simulation_spec.txt


If SIIMPL is used in any publication or presentation, please make reference to:

M. S. Janson, Hydrogen diffusion and ion implantation in silicon carbide, Ph.D. thesis, KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, 2003, ISSN: 0284-0545

Known issues:
It appears that the integration to the SRIM exe file does not work any longer. 

Good Luck!
